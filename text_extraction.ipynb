(NAFLD), characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, is an increasing global healthcare burden. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) functions as a preventive molecule for NAFLD with incompletely clarified regulatory mechanisms. Metabolic changes and gut microbiota imbalance are critical to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, their association with SIRT2 in NAFLD progression is still unknown. Here, we report that SIRT2 knockout (KO) mice are susceptible to HFCS (high-fat/high-cholesterol/high-sucrose)-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis accompanied with an aggravated metabolic profile, which indicates SIRT2 deficiency promotes NAFLD-NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) progression. Under palmitic acid (PA), cholesterol (CHO), and high glucose (Glu) conditions, SIRT2 deficiency promotes lipid deposition and inflammation in cultured cells. Mechanically, SIRT2 deficiency induces serum metabolites alteration including upregulation of L-proline and downregulation of phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and epinephrine. Furthermore, SIRT2 deficiency promotes gut microbiota dysbiosis. The microbiota composition clustered distinctly in SIRT2 KO mice with decreased <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Eubacterium</i>, and increased <i>Acetatifactor</i>. In clinical patients, SIRT2 is downregulated in the NALFD patients compared with healthy controls, and is associated with exacerbated progression of normal liver status to NAFLD to NASH in clinical patients. In conclusion, SIRT2 deficiency accelerates HFCS-induced NAFLD-NASH progression by inducing alteration of gut microbiota and changes of metabolites.\n","Year:\t\t 2023\n"]}],"source":["handle =
